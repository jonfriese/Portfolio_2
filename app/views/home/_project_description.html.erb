        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p>LinkSensei is a project I began with two other classmates in the 4th week of Codefellows.</p>
        <h4>Project Details</h4>
        <p>LinkSensei currently gives you a way to easily group bookmarks. A user can create containers for links, add descriptions, add links to a staging area, and move links to appropriate containers. Looking forward, we plan to implement a sharing feature as well as create a Google Chrome extension. </p>
